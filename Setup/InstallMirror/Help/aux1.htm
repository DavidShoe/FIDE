		<h2>Description</h2>
		Allows for sending and receiving data between the 9010A and other
		devices using the RS-232 Interface Option.
		<ul>
			<li> The string parameter represents the text to be sent.
			<br><br>
			<li> The text is separated from the AUX keyword by a single
			space, hyphen, or tab.
			<br><br>
			<li> Any spaces beyond the single separating character are treated
			as part of the display message, resulting in leading blanks.
			<br><br>
			<li> The AUX string can contain a maximum of 32 characters.
			<br><br>
			<li> Spaces at the end of an AUX string are ignored. If trailing blanks
			are desired, the appropriate number of underscores should be appended
			to the AUX string.
			<br><br>
			<li> Characters allowed in the AUX string are limited to those available
			on the 9010A. 
			<br><br>
			<li> The functions of the special AUX I/F characters are shown below. Symbolic
			register names can be used with these special AUX characters. Symbolic register
			names are counted as one character in the AUX string.
			<br><br>
			<li> A symbolic register name cannot be immediately followed by a 
			hexadecimal character (0-9, A-F). A separating space is required.
			<br><br>
		</ul>

			<td>#</td>
			<td>Sends a control G (bell) to the RS-232 interface.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>$</td>
			<td>When followed by a hexadecimal digit or symbolic register name, $
			causes the contents of the designated register to be transmitted in
			hexadecimal to the RS-232 interface.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>@</td>
			<td>Same as the $ symbol, except that the contents are transmitted in decimal.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>/</td>
			<td>When / is followed by a hexsdecimal digit or symbolic register name, 
			it suspends program execution, waits for the next byte of data from the
			RS-232 interface, and places the value of the byte in the designated
			register. (The upper three bytes of the register equal zero.) If the RS-232
			interface is configured to transfer eight data bits, then eight data bits
			appear. Otherwise, the eight data bit (bit 7) is zero.</td>
