<table width=100% cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0>
<tr valign=top>
	<td class=Content width=60%>
		<h2>Description</h2>
		Displays the string on the 9010A.
		<ul>
			<li> Text to be displayed is separated from the DPY keyword by a single
			space, hyphen, or tab.
			<br><br>
			<li> Any spaces beyond the single separating character are treated
			as part of the display message, resulting in leading blanks.
			<br><br>
			<li> The DPY string can contain a maximum of 32 characters.
			<br><br>
			<li> Spaces at the end of an DPY string are ignored. If trailing blanks
			are desired, the appropriate number of underscores should be appended
			to the DPY string.
			<br><br>
			<li> Characters allowed in the DPY string are limited to those available
			on the 9010A. 
			<br><br>
			<li> The functions of the special DPY characters are shown below. Symbolic
			register names can be used with these special AUX characters. Symbolic register
			names are counted as one character in the AUX string.
			<br><br>
			<li> A symbolic register name cannot be immediately followed by a 
			hexadecimal character (0-9, A-F). A separating space is required.
			<br><br>
		</ul>

		<tr>
			<th>Character</th>
			<th>Action Caused</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>#</td>
			<td>Causes the 9010A to beep when DPY is executed. This symbol does not appear on the display when DPY is executed</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>$</td>
			<td>When followed by a hexadecimal digit or symbolic register name, $
			causes the contents of the designated register to be transmitted in
			hexadecimal on the display.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>@</td>
			<td>Same as the $ symbol, except that the contents are displayed in decimal.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>/</td>
			<td>When / is followed by a hexadecimal digit or symbolic register name, 
			it suspends program execution and waits for input. When the operator
			enters a hexadecimal value terminated by ENTER, the 9010A places the value in the
			designated register and resumes program execution. Pressing the ENDER without
			specifying a hexadeimcal values causes the value to default to the previous
			contents of the register.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>\</td>
			<td>Same as for the / symbole, except that the 9010A accepts only a decimal entry.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>?</td>
			<td>When ? is followed by a hexadecimal digit or symbolic register name, it suspends
			program execution and displays the question mark (?). If the operator presses the
			CLEAR/NO key, the 9010A places a 0 in the designated register. If the operator
			presses the ENTER/YES key, the 9010A plaes a 1 in the designated register.
			After the 1 or 0 is placed in the register, the 9010A removes the quesiton mark
			and then resumes program execution.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>%</td>
			<td>When % is followed by a hexadecimal digit or symbolic register name, it enables or disables
			asynchronous input from the operator during execution.
			Asynchronous input is stored in the register designated by the hexadecimal digit or symbolic
			register name. </td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>+</td>
			<td>When + is the first character in the specification, it causes following characters in the 
			spefification to be appeneded to the text that is on the
			display at the time DPY is executed. </td>
		</tr>
		
	</table>
	
	NOTE: in order to cause one of the special symbols to be displayed in the case where the symbol is followed by a hexadecimal
	digit or symbolic register name, the symbol must appear twice in the specification.
