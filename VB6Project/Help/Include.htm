		<h2>Description</h2>
		Used to include another program or code segment in your
		current program. <br>
		<br>
		<font color=red><b>FIDE Enhancement:</b></font> One of
		the important enhancements FIDE implements is the ability
		to include relative path and long file names. A few notes 
		about the include directive:
		<ul>
			<li> There are finite limits to the depth of the includes (legacy compiler limit).
			<br><br><li> Use "~/" to indicate that the include is relative to your current project
				directory. An include of "~/lib/Test.9lc" would translate to a physical
				path of "C:\Your Scripts\Lib\Test.9lc" if your project root was "C:\Your Scripts".
			<br><br><li> If you do not use the "~/" specifier, then the include paths are relative
				to your current location.
			<br><br><li> <b>Pod includes are handled automatically</b> Any include file ending with ".pod"
				is assumed to be a built-in pod include file.
			<br><br><li> You cannot include two files of the same name, even if they exists in two 
				directories. I.e. you cannot include "~/lib/FileA.9lc" and "~/util/FileA.9lc"
				in the same script. The program will not compile properly.
			<br><br><li> You can include a file anywhere in your script.
			<br><br>
		</ul>
